Some instructions to get you started with this preliminary[toy] code editor:

1. Install the ftgl C bindings. If you're on Ubuntu, use:

   sudo apt-get install libftgl-dev libftgl2

2. OPTIONAL: Install fork of FTGL bindings which more gracefully handles missing font files:

  git clone https://github.com/Peaker/FTGL
  cd FTGL
  cabal install

3. Build and install lamdu's dependencies and lamdu itself:

  cabal install

  Alternatively, you can:

  cabal install --only-dependencies
  cabal configure
  cabal build

  But this will require running the Editor directly from the
  source root dir, because without an install, it will search the
  font only relatively to the directory from which it was executed.

4. Run lamdu, either from your cabal bindir [e.g: ~/.cabal/bin/Editor], or from the build directory (dist/build/Editor/Editor).

5. Press: alt-n (make new definition)

6. Type this line into the Editor slowly, key-by-key, including
spaces, and examine what happens after each key stroke:

fac x=if x=0 1 x*f x-1

NOTE: If you make a mistake at any time, use undo/redo (Ctrl-z, Ctrl-y)

This should result in:

fac x = if (x == 0) 1 (x * fac (x - 1))

Type information is used to filter out non-sense and offer more
sensible edit operations gven your keys, ando ne of the side
effects is having to input much less.

This toy example took 22 key strokes instead of 39 required by an ordinary text editor.

7. Move cursor to the "fac" application in "fac (x - 1)"

8. Press <return> to jump to the definition

9. Press <return> again to rename. Rename it to "factorial"
